Doing the Hello World tutorial

Hello! Synthdroid here. I'm a coding student who was sent over to GitHub via Khan Academy. I'm excited to learn how to code and host my own projects on GitHub while I'm getting ready to go back to school! 

I live on the west coast of the USA with my wife and our Chihuahua. Right now I work in customer service but I'm hoping to get into a coding job after school. My other interests are drawing and writing stories, and hanging out with my family.
